          <h2 class="pt-5 pb-2">"Joining the Farm Fresh Food Relief project was an obvious choice for us, and a great way to provide food to families who need it right now."</h2>
          <p class="blog"><a href="https://www.froghollow.com">Frog Hollow Farm</a> is a 243 acre, organic, stone fruit farm in Brentwood, California. Started in 1976 by Louisiana born and Berkeley bred “Farmer Al” Courchesne, Frog Hollow Farm boasts a commitment to land regeneration, farm-worker wellness, and of course, delicious fruit.</p>
          <p class="blog">“We were immediately concerned for the safety and well-being of our employees,” explained Rachel Sullivan, who manages the Farm Fresh Food Relief project at Frog Hollow Farm.</p>
          <p class="blog">Right away, Frog Hollow Farm convened round table meetings with their packing and field teams to create an open space for dialogue around safety and COVID-19. From there, they held multiple training sessions utilizing <a href="https://aghealth.ucdavis.edu/covid19">COVID-19 safety resources</a> developed by UC Davis. Rachel expressed gratitude for the support from UC Davis. Because everything was happening so quickly, it was very helpful to not have to reinvent the wheel.</p>
          <p class="blog">Although COVID-19 presented many new obstacles, Rachel says Frog Hollow has weathered the storm particularly well because of their ability to quickly adapt. This has meant being proactive, from redesigning their packing shed, to developing branded Frog Hollow face coverings, and installing more handwashing stations. “We emphasized education from the start,” Rachel concludes.</p>
          <p class="blog">As far as the economic impact, Frog Hollow is a good example of how diversifying your product line and market outlets can protect your interests during unexpected emergencies and economic downturns.</p>
          <p class="blog">Although first and foremost a fruit orchard, Frog Hollow has for several years offered other pantry items supplied from like-minded local purveyors like jams, baked goods, grains, and flour they mill themselves. These other items made their CSA program a very good option for families who could no longer shop easily due to the shelter-in-place orders.</p>
          <p class="blog">Even though they’ve lost most of their restaurant business, their CSA program has grown so significantly that they’ve even been able to bring on more employees. While the rest of the economy faces extreme downturn, Frog Hollow Farm is a great example of how the local food system can weather the storm of COVID-19 and become even stronger. </p>
          <p class="blog">Back in March, Frog Hollow Farm was looking for ways to give back to their community in response to COVID-19. Rachel says that joining the Farm Fresh Food Relief project was an obvious choice for Frog Hollow and a “great way to provide food to families who need it right now. Because we already had a CSA program, it was an easy decision.”</p>
          <p class="blog">As part of the project, Frog Hollow Farm is delivering 1200 CSA boxes every week to the Brentwood Union School district, feeding families who live just miles away from the farm. “A lot of our farmworkers’ kids go to the school, so it’s been exciting for our employees to feel part of it.”</p>
          <p class="blog">The mission of the Farm Fresh Food Relief project is to immediately serve the food security needs of families due to COVID-19. But in addition to that, it’s alway been our intention to use this moment to strengthen the local food system altogether. To that end, Rachel and Frog Hollow Farm have been very happy with the partnership with the school district.</p>
          <p class="blog">“We’d always wanted to work with Brentwood Unified,” Rachel says, “but this actually made it happen. We are already planning with them on how to continue the partnership after the project ends. We would love to provide our fruit into their cafeterias and even host field trips to our farm.” </p>
          <p class="blog">The logo of Frog Hollow Farm — a smiling frog with a magician’s hat, cape, and wand — looks as if it came from a storybook and is the perfect distillation of the farm’s mission: “a celebration of the joyful abundance of fruit and nature enjoyed by the whole community.” Sharing this inspiring mission with the families impacted by COVID-19 is the heart of this project: food is nutrition, food is wellness, food is magic.</p>
